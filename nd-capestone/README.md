## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, we were given the opportunity to work on a real case of challenging problem, many user-facing 
organisation have to cope with.
Being capable to identify and predict potential churn users can be a game changer for many companies, in developing
incentives to retain as possible such users.

Along the project we will:
- work on a dataset (128MB) provided by Udacity in collaboration with Sparkify
- clean & manipulate the data using PySpark
- Conduct data analysis to explore our dataset and understand valuable features to extract into our predictive model
- Feature engineering. Transforming variables of interest into usable assets for our models.
- Modeling using best suited ML algorithm for our problem/use case.
